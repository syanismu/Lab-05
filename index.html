            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Not long ago in the year 1997, <em>Shania emerged from her mothers womb</em>. Born to Argentine parents,
                she
                was
                the <b>first</b> Canadian to grace the family.
                Having two much older siblings, Shania grew up mostly on her own in Innisfil, Ontario. <em>Despite
                    the
                    large
                    age gap, her and her siblings are very close.</em>
            </p>

            <p>Shania spent her elementary days at Alcona Glen and her high school days at Nantyr Shores.
                She took a year off to save up money and spent a month traveling through China. An amazing trip with
                amazing
                memories and <b>a scar on her leg to remember the monkey who bit her.</b>
                In 2017, Shania attended the BUSN program at Georgian College, however due to the strike she got a
                refund
                and chose to go back in 2018.
                She only attended 1 semester of BUSN in 2018 before deciding it wasn't for her.
            </p>

            <p>After Shania's trip to China, she applied to EB Games where she worked for <strong>5 years</strong>.
                She started off as a part time employee and worked her way up to <em>Store Manager</em>.
                First starting at the Barrie South location, she later helped out in the Georgian Mall, Bradford,
                Orillia,
                Alliston, and the HWY 7 in Vaughan locations.
                She also helped out at Fan Expo at the EB Games booth <em>3 seperate years</em>.
                When she got promoted to <em>Assistant Manager</em> she worked in Orangeville. <strong>She was there for
                    7 months
                    before being promoted to Store Manager</strong> of Wasaga Beach.

                In the future, Shania wishes to graduate from her Computer Programming program.
                When she finds something to specialize in, she will either go back to school to gain more knowledge
                or
                jump
                straight into the workforce.
                Once in the workforce, Shania hopes to eventually find a job that can sustain her desire to travel
                the
                world
                and give her cat a wonderful life
