        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Not long ago in the year 1997, <em>Shania emerged from her mothers womb</em>. Born to Argentine parents, she
            was
            the <b>first</b> Canadian to grace the family.
            <br>Having two much older siblings, Shania grew up mostly on her own in Innisfil, Ontario. <em>Despite the
                large
                age gap, her and her siblings are very close.</em>
        </p>

        <p>Shania spent her elementary days at Alcona Glen and her high school days at Nantyr Shores.
            <br>She took a year off to save up money and spent a month traveling through China. An amazing trip with
            amazing
            memories and <b>a scar on her leg to remember the monkey who bit her.</b>
            <br>In 2017, Shania attended the BUSN program at Georgian College, however due to the strike she got a
            refund
            and chose to go back in 2018.
            <br>She only attended 1 semester of BUSN in 2018 before deciding it wasn't for her.
        </p>

        <p>After Shania's trip to China, she applied to EB Games where she worked for <strong>5 years</strong>.
            <br>She started off as a part time employee and worked her way up to <em>Store Manager</em>.
            <br>First starting at the Barrie South location, she later helped out in the Georgian Mall, Bradford,
            Orillia,
            Alliston, and the HWY 7 in Vaughan locations.
            <br>She also helped out at Fan Expo at the EB Games booth <em>3 seperate years</em>.
            <br>When she got promoted to <em>Assistant Manager</em> she worked in Orangeville. <strong>She was there for
                7 months
                before being promoted to Store Manager</strong> of Wasaga Beach.
        </p>

        <p>In the future, Shania wishes to graduate from her Computer Programming program.
            <br>When she finds something to specialize in, she will either go back to school to gain more knowledge or
            jump
            straight into the workforce.
            <br>Once in the workforce, Shania hopes to eventually find a job that can sustain her desire to travel the
            world
            and give her cat a wonderful life
